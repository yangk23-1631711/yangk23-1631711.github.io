        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a sophomore here at the University of Washington majoring in emotional stress with a minor of anxiety.
            Just kidding, my intended major is HCDE and/or psychology. I am born and raised in Bellevue, WA and love the PNW. 
            Some of my many passions include adventuring, taking photos, and reading! 
        </p>
        <p>One day I hope to be able to work with Weiden and Kennedy, they're an agency that has created some pretty crazy content.
            They created the nike slogan "Just Do it", as well as the #ThankyouMom olympic videos by proctor and gamble. That stuf speaks to me!
        </p>
